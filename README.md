# Introduction
The following repository consists of the assignment I did as a part of my coursework "Astrostatistics". I was required to do three assignments. \\ 

# Assignment 1:
**The assignment had four main objectives:**
<ul type="disc">
  <li>To write an MCMC code to estimate cosmological parameters h, which is the
hubble parameter and Î©m, which is the matter density parameter, from the
supernova dataset, assuming the Universe is flat and the errors are a gaussian.</li>
  <li>Use the burn-in process to reject unimportant data and plot a scatter data of
the samples.</li>
  <li>To compare the theoretical values of distance modulus as a function of redshift
with the observed one and plot a graph. </li>
  <li>To show how the acceptance probability changes as you change the size of the
proposal distribution from very small (say 0.001) to very large (say 100).</li>
</ul>
